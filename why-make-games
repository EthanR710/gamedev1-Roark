# My Motivation

My motivation to become a game designer and make my own games stems from my childhood. I played my first game, Call of Duty: World at War, at the age of 2 years old. Ever since then, I have been playing so many different games and experiencing so many different styles that I wanted to make my own. Since I was young, I wanted to make my own game.
It didn't matter if it turned out to be horrible, I just wanted to make a video game.

## Influential Games/Creators

The game that has inspired me the most has to be Borderlands 2. The story, the mechanics, the setting, it all brought me into a new realm of possibilities.
A creator that has inspired me for years is a youtuber that goes by the name Code Bullet. He makes videos of him making his own little games, coding ideas, and challenging himself to become better and better. That's the type of person I want to be.
